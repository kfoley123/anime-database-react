The purpose of this app is to allow users to access anime titles from a database using an API call. The app allows you to filter results by keyword, rating, animation type and/or airing status. It shows key details about each title and links to a synopsis and trailer if availble.

Ever wonder if your favorite series has any movies, OVA's or Specials? Simply enter a keyword and/or select a filer dropdown to narrow your results!
